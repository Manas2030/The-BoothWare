# The BoothWare

This is an implementation of Booth&#39; Algorithm for multiplying signed and unsigned binary numbers.

**Motivation:**

It is difficult to see and understand that why the Booth&#39;s Algorithm does works and produces correct answer. By this project I hope to understand the algorithm in depth and also help someone new to understand the same by showing the status of different registers during each cycle.

**Prerequisites:**

java installed (preferably with an IDE)

**Features:**

- --Great way to understand the Booth&#39;s Algorithm.
- --Option to see all the steps of the computation in the algorithm.
- --Can multiply both signed and unsigned integers.

**How to use?**

Easy ! Run the &#39;boothAlgorithm.java&#39;  in a suitable JAVA IDE. Do not alter the file locations of different files in the folder &#39;Booth&#39;s Algorithm&#39;. Read Documentation for more details.
